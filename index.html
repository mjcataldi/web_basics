    <h1>Dogs are Great</h1>
    <p>Dogs are great pets.  They are <em>loyal</em> and always up in your bizness.  They also give you <strong>free baths</strong> when they lick your face.

      <li>They're awesome</li>
      <li>They're cool</li>
      <li>They're there</li>
    </ul>
    
    Here are some other advantages to having a dog:
    <ol>
      <li>They are territorial, meaning they are like a free body guard</li>
      <li>They are great for picking up dates</li>
      <li>They eat the rest of your food when you do not want it.</li>
    </ol>
